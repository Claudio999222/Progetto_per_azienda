# Production Tracking System

In this notebook, we will create a .csv file to store and load the following data:

1. **Workstations**
2. **Pieces**
3. **Date**
4. **Shift**
5. **Names**

The company under consideration is involved in the creation of tables, and we will calculate:

- The pieces processed in a week
- The completed tables created in a week
- The performance trends of an individual worker
- The comparison between two workers performing the same role based on the pieces produced

This system can be developed for any manufacturing facility, leading effortlessly to a meritocratic and efficient system.

**Features:**
- Data recording for workstations, pieces, date, shift, and worker names.
- Weekly production analysis for pieces and completed tables.
- Individual worker performance tracking.
- Worker-to-worker comparison based on production.

**Future Enhancements:**
This system can be extended with the implementation of AI to accurately forecast future trends in production. Updates will be provided in the future.

**Note:**
The current version of the file ends here and can be extended with the addition of AI to predict future trends in performance and production. Further updates will be added.

Feel free to customize and expand this document based on specific details or additional features in your implementation.
